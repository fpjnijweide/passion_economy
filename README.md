# Passion economy creator income data

In this repository, I explore the distribution of income of Patreon and OnlyFans creators. 

The sources used for this research are [Graphtreon](https://graphtreon.com/) and [ranking-fans.com](https://ranking-fans.com) (NSFW). These sites aggregate data from Patreon and Onlyfans. With only a few API calls, I was able to gather income data for hundreds of thousands of creators.

This research was conducted for the [Good Data Initiative](https://www.gooddatainitiative.com/), a Cambridge-based think tank. It will be used in a review article on the passion economy, that will be published in October 2021. The idea to use raw data from these platforms to reach conclusions about inequalities and the distribution of wealth was largely inspired by Thomas Hollands' article [The Economics of Onlyfans](https://xsrus.com/the-economics-of-onlyfans). While the initial approach was basde on his [source code](https://github.com/ThomHollands/onlyfans) and the data he scraped, the final research does not use his dataset as it is too small (and biased towards popular creators).

All the data, figures and other information can be found in the .ipynb file.
